This Directed Research Group was held in Winter Quarter 2024 and became an open exploration of aspects of Generative AI as they existed at that time. Our group split the time between weekly readings and investigative work. 

**Members**
- Professor: <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/marks">Alan Marks</a>

**Reading**

Each week, the group read one article or paper together, which we then discussed. Additionally, each team member read an additional article, wrote up a brief summary, and led discussion. This work is encapsulated in the annotated bibliography available on this site. 

**Research**

The DRG members divided into three groups, each focused on research in a different area. The results of each of these projects are summarized here as well.
